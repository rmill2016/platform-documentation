## Hosting

CloudCannon is an all-in-one Content Management System with hosting included. Every site has its own [.cloudvent.net domain name](/documentation/articles/viewing-your-site-on-a-testing-domain) and is hosted on a super-fast Content Delivery Network (CDN) supported by Cloudflare. For a production site, you can [point your domain to your site](/documentation/articles/hosting-your-site-on-a-custom-domain) or use [CloudCannon DNS](/documentation/articles/using-cloudcannon-dns-to-configure-your-custom-domain) to automate the setup.

All sites receive an SSL certificate, can easily scale to handle any amount of traffic, and offer [custom routing and headers](/documentation/articles/configuring-custom-routing/#custom-headers), [form submissions](/documentation/articles/getting-started-with-forms-on-cloudcannon), and [various authentication options](/documentation/articles/adding-password-authentication-to-your-site).

## Next Steps (optional)

We’ve covered everything you need to know to get started — but it doesn’t end there! Here are some optional steps for you to explore.

### Branding

Adding your brand to CloudCannon is a great way to make the app look and feel like your organization.

You can set your primary color — this is mainly used in the side nav and buttons. Your logo is used in two places: a badge in the top left corner with your brand's primary color behind it and on the top of the *Home*, *Project*, *Sites*, and *Domains* pages with a white background behind it.

Access your [branding](/documentation/articles/customizing-cloudcannon-to-match-your-brand) by navigating to the *Branding* tab, under *Org Settings*.
