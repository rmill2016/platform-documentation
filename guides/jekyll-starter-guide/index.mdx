Welcome to the CloudCannon Jekyll starter guide! If you want to get your Jekyll site built, editable, and live on CloudCannon, you are in the right place.

Before we start, this guide assumes you already have a Jekyll site uploaded to a Git repository. Although you can [upload files directly](/documentation/articles/add-files-with-direct-upload) from your hard drive, we highly recommend using a Git repository.

Donâ€™t have a Jekyll site yet? No worries! You can create one with our [Jamstack tutorials for your favorite SSGs](/tutorials).
