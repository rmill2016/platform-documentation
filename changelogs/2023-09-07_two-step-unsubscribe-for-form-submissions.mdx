This release added a second confirmation when unsubscribing from CloudCannon form submissions. It also addressed issues affecting Cloudinary URLs, colons in the rich text editor, and the Add Credit Card modal on mobile.

**Features:**

* Added a second confirmation when unsubscribing from [CloudCannon form](/documentation/articles/integrating-your-forms-with-email) submissions.

**Fixes:**

* Fixed an issue where URLs saved from the Cloudinary widget were missing the prefix.
* Fixed instances where colons in the rich text editor were escaped too often.
* Fixed an issue where the Add Credit Card modal was cut off on mobile.
